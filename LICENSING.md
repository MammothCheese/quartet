complete source under the same licence too.

| The LM-1 kit's sounds, "Linn LM1 (LM-1) Drum Set" by rossf (Freesound pack 4919), six of them trimmed and stored 8-bit mu-law in `firmware/gen/lm1_samples.h` (by `tools/samples2c.py`).

## The logo

`assets/logo.svg` is QUARTET's own logo (four stompboxes in the track colours), under the GPL like the rest. (Dinghy's
designburg signet is not part of QUARTET.)
